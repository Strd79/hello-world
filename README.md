# hello-world
This is my Hello World first GitHub repo

Hi I'm David, just starting on my coding journey.

This has been updated in Git.	

I changed this on GitHub to try and pull into git on my Mac.

I changed this again in Git, to then push to GitHub.

Trying to push this to gitHub using email address: strd79@hotmail.co.uk
